              <p>
              <center>Our application, Virgilâ€™s Travels, aims to provide an interactive, all encompassing 
                travel site that provides users with various options other sites may lack. We strive to make 
                our application as social as possible by having users create profiles and see what other 
                users have purchased, reviewed, and shared about their trips. The site itself was created by
                a group of 5 computer science students attending California State University Long Beach.
                Our team consists of David Ibarra, Bryan Rojas, Clayton Asada, Hector Mendoza, and 
                Brandon Mitchell. This site is still in development, and we hope to see some great improvement
                coming in the near future. Thanks for checking out our about us! We hope you stick around to
                see our website progress! </center>
